description: "For the past four years I have been working on perfecting a template to kickstart website projects, but also to build a better bridge of communication between designer and developer. Over time that perspective expanded to also include how I could optimise the process in the design-phase and the workflow, plus ensuring the documentation of the design was as much covered as possible to avoid basic questions, such as; \"How does the grid behave?\", \"What is the typography hierarchy?\", \"How does this component look on mobile/in this media query?\", \"Where can I get the logo, colours, overview of the buttons, form elements, and much more...?\"."
