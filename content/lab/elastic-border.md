## Overview

This experimental component brings borders to life with spring physics. As users move their cursor near the border, it bends and follows with natural momentum.

## Technical Details

- **Spring Constants**: Configurable stiffness and damping
- **Velocity Tracking**: Mouse speed influences bend intensity
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated with requestAnimationFrame
- **Integration**: Works with any CSS border

## Use Cases

- Hero sections and dividers
- Interactive card separators
- Playful navigation elements
- Portfolio showcase effects
