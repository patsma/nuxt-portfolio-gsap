## Challenge

Vertex needed to bring their desktop analytics platform to mobile. The challenge was distilling complex data visualizations into a format that works on smaller screens without losing critical insights.

## Solution

We designed a progressive disclosure approach where users see high-level summaries first, with the ability to drill down into details. Custom chart components were optimized for touch interaction and variable screen sizes.

## Results

Mobile adoption exceeded targets, with users appreciating the ability to monitor key metrics anywhere.
