## Challenge

Lumina needed a cohesive brand identity that would resonate with their target audience while establishing credibility in a competitive market. Their existing visual language felt fragmented and didn't communicate their innovative approach.

## Solution

We developed a complete brand system including logo, typography, color palette, and extensive digital applications. The design language balances professionalism with approachability, using clean geometry and a vibrant yet sophisticated color scheme.

## Results

The new brand identity helped Lumina establish a stronger market presence and improved recognition across all touchpoints.
