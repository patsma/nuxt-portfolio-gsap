## Challenge

Horizon's online store needed to match the quality of their physical products. The existing site felt generic and failed to convey the craftsmanship behind each item.

## Solution

We created an art-directed experience with carefully composed product photography guidelines, immersive detail views, and a checkout flow that feels effortless. Every interaction reinforces the brand's attention to detail.

## Results

Conversion rates increased and average order value grew as customers engaged more deeply with product content.
