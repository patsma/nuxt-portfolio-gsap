## Challenge

Recommendating needed a fresh approach to their mobile dating app. The existing interface felt dated and didn't reflect the brand's focus on meaningful connections over superficial matches.

## Solution

We developed a clean, modern interface that puts user profiles and genuine conversation at the forefront. The design emphasizes quality over quantity, with thoughtful interaction patterns that encourage deeper engagement.

## Results

The redesign resulted in increased user engagement and positive feedback on the improved user experience.
