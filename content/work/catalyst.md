## Challenge

Catalyst's existing platform had grown organically over years, resulting in a cluttered interface with inconsistent patterns. Users struggled to complete core tasks efficiently, leading to frustration and reduced adoption.

## Solution

We conducted extensive user research to identify pain points and opportunities. The redesigned interface introduces a modular dashboard system, streamlined navigation, and contextual tools that surface at the right moment.

## Results

User task completion rates improved significantly, and the new design system enabled faster feature development.
