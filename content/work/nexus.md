## Challenge

Nexus's website hadn't been updated in years. It was slow, difficult to maintain, and no longer represented the caliber of work they produce. A ground-up redesign was needed.

## Solution

We rebuilt the site with modern technologies, focusing on performance and maintainability. The new design emphasizes their portfolio work with large imagery, smooth transitions, and intuitive navigation.

## Results

Page load times improved dramatically, bounce rates decreased, and the site now serves as an effective business development tool.
