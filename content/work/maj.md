## Challenge

Maj required a complete visual identity that could work seamlessly across digital and physical touchpoints while maintaining a distinctive and memorable presence.

## Solution

We created a flexible design system with bold typography, a refined color palette, and custom iconography that adapts beautifully across web, mobile, and print applications.

## Results

The new identity successfully positioned Maj as a modern, forward-thinking brand in their market.
