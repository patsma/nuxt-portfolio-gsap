## Challenge

Prism's product suite had evolved with different teams working independently, resulting in inconsistent user experiences and duplicated development effort. They needed a unified design language.

## Solution

We built a comprehensive design system from the ground up: design tokens, accessibility-first components, detailed documentation, and governance processes. The system serves as a single source of truth for design and development.

## Results

Development velocity increased as teams could leverage pre-built components. User satisfaction improved with consistent, predictable interactions.
