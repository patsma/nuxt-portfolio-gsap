Hi, I’m Patryk.

I wear many hats — dreamer, reader, writer, stoic, task-executioner, animator, developer, “computers guy,” music guy, graphics guy, drone pilot, occasional archer, and video editor… probably a few more if I think long enough. 😉

When I’m not building or animating something on the web, you’ll likely find me:

- Walking or cycling in nature with my better half
- Kayaking with friends
- Practicing bushcraft or enjoying the forest
- Hanging out with animals (currently: four sweet chinchillas 🐹🐹🐹🐹)

**Early Days**

I was born in 1990 in the coastal city of Gdynia, Poland, though most of my life I spent in the countryside.

My story with computers started around age 10–12. They felt like magic, the closest thing humans had to bending reality. Around that time I also fell in love with books — especially fantasy and sci-fi (Ender’s Game, Lord of the Rings, and any story that could transport me elsewhere).

I followed the “official path” with Computer Science through to college, but eventually found the theory outdated and uninspiring. So I turned to self-learning, trying everything from design and animation to completely non-digital jobs — a way to balance out all those hours in front of screens.

Here’s a taste of that journey:

- 🏗 Construction work
- 🧹 City cleaning services
- 🐟 Serving live fish in a mall
- 📄 Flyers, shelves, and stock work
- 🛡 Mall security
- 🍔 McDonald’s
- 🎮 Xbox promoter
- 🌐 Installing internet at homes
- 🎨 Newsletter graphics
- 🛒 Online shop admin
- 🎬 Video montage for technical courses
- 💼 My own company: Tasty Sites
- 🌍 Freelancing on UpWork (clients from Seattle to Sydney)
- 🤝 Collaborations with agencies like Green Rubino, We Push Buttons, We Are Original People, Barenholt
- 🎶 Music & video production
- 🎮 Blockchain game project
- 🎤 Life Balance Congress & portfolio builds

**Why “Tasty Sites”?**

My last name, Smakosz, translates roughly to “the Taster.” That’s the origin of Tasty Sites:

- Websites → creative, handcrafted digital experiences
- Tasty sites of life → adventures, drone clips, and moments I share on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj7wr_x-BwJ0Yam8uw5lDsw)

**Beyond the Nerdy Stuff**

Despite the mostly tech CV, I’m a social creature at heart. People, friendships, and connections are what keep me grounded. I love forest walks, riding bikes, gaming nights with friends, and discovering new stories in every form — books, games, films, or conversations.

And speaking of stories, that leads us to the next part: Why.
