/*
  Pre-Tailwind SCSS bundle
  - Compiled to pre.css and imported by main.css BEFORE Tailwind
  - Place design tokens, base resets and utilities that must exist prior
    to Tailwind so its responsive variants and layers can build on top.
*/

/* Design tokens and global theme variables */
@use "./tokens/theme.scss";

/* Base element resets or minimal globals */
@use "./base/base.scss";

/* Custom utilities that should allow responsive variants to override */
@use "./utilities/typography.scss";

/*
  Notes:
  - Keep this file small and focused. Prefer composables-like structure for SCSS.
  - Avoid Tailwind directives here. Tailwind is imported only in main.css.
