  Post-Tailwind SCSS bundle
  - Compiled to post.css and imported by main.css AFTER Tailwind
  - Place component-level CSS and any overrides relying on Tailwind utilities

  Notes:
  - Do not import Tailwind here. main.css owns the Tailwind import.
  - Keep files small and focused; split if this grows beyond ~200 lines.
